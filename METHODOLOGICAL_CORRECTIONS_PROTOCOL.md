# Methodological Corrections Protocol

**Document Type:** Research Methodology Correction Framework  
**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Purpose:** Systematic correction of identified research gaps and overclaims

---

## Protocol Overview

This document establishes systematic procedures for correcting methodological deficiencies identified in peer review. The protocol addresses empirical validation gaps, reproducibility issues, and claim accuracy problems.

## Section 1: Claim Correction Framework

### 1.1 Systematic Claim Audit

**Procedure:**
1. Identify all capability claims in documentation
2. Map claims to actual implementation evidence
3. Classify claims as: Validated, Partially Supported, Unsupported
4. Revise documentation to reflect evidence-based assessment

**Implementation Status:**

| Claim | Current Status | Evidence Level | Corrective Action |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Complete AI System | Unsupported | None | Revise to "Research Prototype" |
| 100% Test Success | Misleading | Unit Tests Only | Clarify as Mathematical Tests |
| Bulletproof Security | False | 53.8% Detection | Report Actual Performance |
| Self-Awareness | Unsubstantiated | Heuristic Only | Remove or Clarify as State Monitoring |
| Production Ready | False | Research Stage | Correct Classification |

### 1.2 Documentation Revision Standards

**Required Changes:**
- Remove superlative language without empirical support
