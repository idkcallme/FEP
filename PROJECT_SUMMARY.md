# FEP-MCM Cognitive Architecture - Project Summary

## Research Prototype Based on Free Energy Principle

This project implements a research prototype cognitive architecture based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP) with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (MCM) capabilities. The system represents an exploration of FEP concepts applied to computational cognitive modeling.

## Core Implementation

### 1. FEP Mathematical Foundation
- **Hierarchical Bayesian inference** with variational optimization
- **Active inference engine** for action selection under uncertainty
- **Predictive coding hierarchy** with attention mechanisms
- **Free energy minimization** through belief updating

### 2. Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (MCM)
- **Real-time cognitive state monitoring** using engineered heuristics
- **Anomaly detection** for unusual cognitive patterns
- **Adaptive precision control** based on system confidence
- **State classification** for cognitive health assessment

### 3. Research Discovery: "Lazy Student" Pattern
- **Mathematical characterization** of cognitive bias in AI systems
- **VFE-based diagnosis** of preference for simple over complex truths
- **Training protocol** to address complexity appreciation
- **Empirical validation** through controlled experiments
