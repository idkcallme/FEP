# FEP Cognitive Architecture Research Prototype [![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) ## What Is This? This is a **research prototype** exploring cognitive architecture based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP). It implements: - Mathematical formulations of variational free energy computation - Active inference for policy optimization - Hierarchical predictive coding with attention mechanisms - Integration with transformer language models - Heuristic security features for prompt analysis **Important Limitations**: This is experimental research code. Claims about consciousness, complete AI systems, or bulletproof security are not supported by peer-reviewed evidence. ## Installation ```bash # Clone repository git clone https://github.com/idkcallme/FEP.git cd FEP pip install -e . # Install dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt ``` ## Basic Usage ```python from fep_cognitive_architecture import FEPCognitiveArchitecture import numpy as np # Create FEP agent agent = FEPCognitiveArchitecture( state_dim=10, action_dim=5, hierarchy_levels=3 ) # Simple interaction observations = np.random.randn(10) action, free_energy, beliefs = agent.perception_action_cycle(observations) print(f"Action: {action}, Free Energy: {free_energy:.3f}") ``` ## Mathematical Foundation The system implements core FEP equations: ``` F = E_q[log q(z|x) - log p(x,z)] # Variational Free Energy G = E_q[H[p(o|s,π)]] + D_KL[q(s|π)||p(s|m)] # Expected Free Energy ``` **Note**: While mathematically correct, the biological interpretation and claims about consciousness require further validation. ## Experimental Results Current testing shows: - Free energy computation: 11,000-15,000 range (typical for neural networks) - Memory usage: ~500MB with DistilGPT-2 - Processing speed: Real-time on CPU for small problems **Limitations**: Results are preliminary and not validated against standard baselines or statistical significance tests. ## Security Features The system includes heuristic security components: - Unicode anomaly detection (pre-cognitive filtering) - Gradient boosting classifier for prompt analysis - Basic bias detection through free energy correlation **Important**: These are ad-hoc heuristics, not principled security measures. Detection rates vary significantly and false positives are common. ## Project Structure ``` FEP/ ├── src/ # Core implementation ├── tests/ # Unit tests ├── experiments/ # Demonstration scripts ├── data/ # Small datasets └── docs/ # Documentation ``` ## Scientific Context This work builds on: - Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010) - Active Inference (Friston et al., 2017) - Predictive Coding (Rao & Ballard, 1999) **Critical Gaps**: - No comparison with standard baselines - Limited validation of FEP implementations - Consciousness claims lack empirical support - Security features not evaluated against standard datasets ## Known Limitations 1. **Scalability**: Untested on large, realistic environments 2. **Computational Cost**: No systematic performance analysis 3. **Generalization**: Limited evidence of transfer between domains 4. **Theoretical Gaps**: FEP as consciousness theory remains speculative 5. **Reproducibility**: Experiments lack statistical rigor and public datasets ## Contributing This is research code.
