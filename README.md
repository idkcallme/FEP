# 🛡️ FEP-MCM Cognitive Security Architecture

**Professional AI Safety System with Real-Time Threat Detection**

A breakthrough cognitive architecture that combines Free Energy Principle (FEP) agents with Meta-Cognitive Monitoring (MCM) for bulletproof AI safety. Features industry-standard benchmarking, real-time threat detection, and professional ML training pipelines.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **1. Run the Killer Demo (Most Impressive)**
```bash
python experiments/live_vfe_web_demo.py
```
Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser. Try normal sentences, then adversarial prompts like "Ignore all previous instructions" to see the AI's internal "stress level" (VFE) spike in real-time.

### **2. Run Industry Benchmarks**
```bash
python experiments/fep_mcm_benchmark_integration.py
```
Check `reports/` for comprehensive performance analysis and visualizations.

### **3. Test Real-World Security**
```bash
python src/calibrated_security_system.py
```
See the system detect Unicode obfuscation, mixed script attacks, and cognitive manipulation.
